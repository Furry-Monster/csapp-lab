phase1 be like: Border relations with Canada have never been better.

s = "Border relations with Canada have never been better."

if(input != s){
  explode_bomb();
}else {
  return;
}





phase2 be like: 1 2 4 8 16 32

int arr[];
read_six_number(input,arr);

int current;
int i=0;
int num = 1;
do{
  current = arr[i];
  if(num)
    ...
}
while(current != arr[5])






phase3 has a lot of solution pairs:

0 207
1 707
2 256
3 389
4 206
5 682
6 327
7 0






phase4
I hate math ... 
phase is 0 0 here...







phase5 is a translator

one possible answer should be :

9/>567 , any other alternative for word "flyers" is OK.







phase6:

it's a node list... I hate data structures...

phase is 4 3 2 1 6 5





secret phase :
get out of my computer!
